# LaTeX Resume

This repository contains my resume, which is based on the [mteck's resume template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/mtecks-resume/fzgztpkgngjc). The template provides a clean and professional design, making it an excellent starting point for creating a polished CV.

## Usage

Feel free to use this resume as a reference or adapt it for your own needs. The LaTeX source code is included, so you can customize it as you see fit.

## Note for Employers

If you are an employer interested in hiring me, I kindly ask that you request my resume directly. I frequently tailor my resume by adding or removing sections to ensure it is relevant to the specific job posting. As such, the version in this repository may not fully represent my qualifications or experience for your position.

Thank you for your understanding!
