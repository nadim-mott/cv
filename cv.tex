    \tinysection{Summary}
    Third year Computer Science and Math undergraduate looking to gain hands-on experience
    in a team oriented environment, challenge myself and work on industry
    defining projects. I've been programming since I was 12 years old, a passion
    I developed in tandem with a strong focus on mathematics and design.
    My skills, choices and experiences reflect that I am a strong creative
    thinker, a good people person with an interest in developing useful and
    ethical technology. You may find some of my recent projects on my
    github @nadim-mott.
